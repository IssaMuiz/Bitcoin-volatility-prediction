# Bitcoin Volatility Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the volatility of Bitcoin using historical price data and various machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately forecast future volatility, which can be valuable for traders, investors, and risk managers in the cryptocurrency market.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the raw and processed datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, modeling, and analysis.
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Problem Statement

The cryptocurrency market is known for its high volatility, which can lead to significant financial risks for traders and investors. Accurately predicting Bitcoin's volatility can help market participants make informed decisions, manage risk, and optimize their trading strategies. This project seeks to develop a machine learning model that can forecast Bitcoin's volatility based on historical price data and other relevant features.

## Project Success Criteria

- The model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of less than 0.05 on the test set.
- The model demonstrates consistent performance across different time periods and market conditions.

## Evaluation Metrics

- MAE
- RMSE

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of historical Bitcoin price data, including features such as opening price, closing price, high, low, and trading volume. The data is sourced from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/priyamchoksi/bitcoin-historical-prices-and-activity-2010-] and covers a period from July 27, 2010, to May 22, 2024.

## Current Progress

- Data collection and loading completed.

- Initial data exploration and visualization performed.

- Datetime conversion and basic data cleaning steps implemented.

- Features like log_return, volatility, and range calculated and added to the dataset.

- After adding these features we have some missing values in the dataset, we have handled those missing values by dropping the rows with missing values.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Summary
  Exploratory data analysis was conducted to understand the structure, behavior, and relationships within the dataset. The key findings are as follows:
  1. The OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) features exhibit strong positive correlations, indicating high multicollinearity. Most features are skewed, while the log returns approximate a normal distribution.
  2. Bitcoin prices remained relatively stable from inception until early 2017, after which a sustained upward trend emerged.
  3. Bitcoin volatility was extremely high in the early years, characterized by pronounced cycles of rising and falling risk. However, lower-risk periods became more frequent from 2015 onward, indicating a gradual stabilization of market behavior.
